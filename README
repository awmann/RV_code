Contains RV correction code.

This is meant to help compute RV offsets for metallicity calculation.

All code assumes the spectra are already in vacuum.

A simple example:
download RV code here and the metal code in https://github.com/awmann/metal as well as the fits files.
M1.5V_HD36395.fits is a template from the IRTF spectral library (here for convenience)
Sample.fits is a sample M dwarf. Both spectra are already in vacuum.

Let's RV correct the M dwarf to match the template:
template = mrdfits('M1.5V_HD36395.fits',0)
twave = template[*,0]
tflux = template[*,1]
temp = mrdfits('sample.fits',0)
swave = temp[*,0]
sflux = temp[*,1]
serr = temp[*,2]
compute_xcor_rv,swave,sflux,0,rv,wavelim=[2.0,2.4],norm_reg=[2.0,2.4],maxshift=20,twave=twave,tflux=tflux,showplot=1
print,rv ;; should get about -8 km/s, but you can get slightly different answers by changing wavelim around, which gives you some idea of the errors.
c = 299792.458D
swave/=(rv/c+1.) ;; the wavelengths are now in rest frame
am_getmetal,swave,sflux,serr,1.8,'K',feh,feh_err,mh,mh_err,/doerr
print,feh,feh_Err,mh,mh_err

this should output something like:
-0.16976332     0.034212921     -0.18648235     0.031594626
which is reasonable for this star.
